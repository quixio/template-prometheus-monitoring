# Resource Usage Generator App

This Application mocks out the generation of usage statistics
(as individual events) for a given resource type (CPU, RAM, etc.) and host machine ID 
from 0-5.

Each event is "processed", which is then added to a running count of processed events, 
and that running count is continually sent to Prometheus.


## How it Works

This uses a Quix Streams Source template to both generate and consume generated events
, which are then "processed" by its StreamingDataFrame.

The only "processing" happening is incrementing the count of number of messages handled,
which is tracked with a Prometheus-based object within `MetricsService` from 
`metric_scraper.py`.

Then, the underlying `MetricsService` publishes this count to a Prometheus `Push Gateway Proxy`
periodically (using another underlying thread).

> NOTE: Each running count is Application-instance specific; the count for an instance 
> resets if the Application is restarted.


## How to Use

Simply provide: 

- a desired resource name (ex: `CPU`)
- the Prometheus `Push Gateway Proxy` URL
- the Prometheus `Push Gateway Proxy` password (generated by you)

> Note: when using with the template, only the password needs to be created.


## Notes about the Example

Currently, two example applications are deployed in the same environment for the sake of
simplicity and ease of making a working example. 

It is recommended that you instead deploy your actual applications elsewhere and leave
the monitoring stack in another independent project.
